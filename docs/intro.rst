Introduction
==============

This documentation is organized to support the development process. It contains both high level discussions of why things are implemented the way they are as well as module level API documentation extracted from the code. You should treat this as the 'source of truth' as far the project is concerned. 


If you are joing the team and want to contribute to the source code, you should look through :ref:`gettingstarted`. If you are trying to refacto parts of the code or just want to understand how things work, take a look at :ref:`design`. If you need information on how experiments are organized and performed, look at :ref:`experiments`. Miscellaneous notes are in :ref:`notes`, you might find some useful information there too. The :ref:`ref` page has both external resources, like our Google Drive folder, and also internal resources like the API documentation. All of this is searchable, on the top left corner.
