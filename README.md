Repair is a compression algorithm for graphs. This repository holds the source code for a complete implementation of the compression algorithm as well as the Graphs needed. It also conta reproducable source code for experiments that validate the effectivenes of the algorithm. 

You can find detailed documentation [here](https://repair-graph-compression.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Created and maintained by a team at UVa.
